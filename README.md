# 🃏 Klondike Solitaire (jQuery)

This is a classic **Solitaire** game built with **JavaScript and jQuery**, using drag & drop for card movements.

I made this project mainly to practice game logic, DOM manipulation, and jQuery UI interactions.

---

## Current Features

- Classic Klondike setup (7 columns, stock, waste, foundations)
- Drag & drop cards between columns and foundations
- Automatic win detection
- Timer
- Win alert using SweetAlert with the option to restart the game

---

## Undo Button (Work in Progress)

There is an **Undo button** already added to the interface, but it is **currently disabled**.

The idea is that this button will allow the player to undo the **previous move**.  
This feature is planned and will be implemented in a future update.

---

## Planned Improvements

Things I want to add next:

- Enable undo functionality
- Allow cards placed in the foundation to be moved back (right now, once you place them there, they can’t be removed)
- Add the **3-card draw mode** for the stock (instead of drawing just one card)

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery UI (Drag & Drop)
